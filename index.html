        <ul>
            <li>Cicadas can survive a huge fall as babies, or nymphs. They are about the size of a grain of rice when they drop from a tree branch to the ground and start digging.</li>

            <li>Females may be attracted to the sound of motors. So you get to watch your dad, mom or older sibling get swarmed while they’re using the lawn mower or power tools.</li>
            <li>They improve lawns by digging tunnels that allow air into the soil. When they die, their rotting bodies put nitrogen into the soil.</li>
